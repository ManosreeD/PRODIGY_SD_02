# PRODIGY_SD_02
##Guessing Game

This project is a Python-based interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback to guide the user towards the correct number.

# Features

Random number generation within a specified range.

User-friendly interface to input guesses.

Feedback provided for each guess (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").

Tracks the number of attempts made by the user.

# Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher

# How the Program Works

Set Up the Game:

The program generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).

User Inputs a Guess:

The user is prompted to guess the number.

Receive Feedback:

The program informs the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Repeat Until Correct:

The user continues to guess until the correct number is identified.

The program keeps count of the number of attempts.

# Example Usage

Guess the number between 1 and 100:
Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 37
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 3 attempts.

# Project Structure

task2.py: The main Python script that runs the guessing game.

# Additional Notes

Input validation ensures the user enters numbers within the specified range.

The program handles invalid inputs gracefully and prompts the user to try again.
